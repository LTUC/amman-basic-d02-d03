### **Set up your Github Repository***

- Today you will continue working on your `HR-management-system` repo.
- Update your **README** file to add your changes for today.
- Check out a new branch called `constructor` for today's task.

### **Home page**

1. Replace all of your object literals for the `HR-management-system` with a single constructor function that, when called with the ‘new’ keyword, creates a new instance.

2. You will refactor the render method to be a prototype method to render each employee name, department, and employee salary using `document.write()` or `innerHTML` as the following.

3. Note that you need to keep the methods that are responsible for **generating employeeID** and **calculating the salary**.

# Task 07:

## Overview:
Today will continue working on the Todo website.

## Problem Domain:
You are building a ToDo List Web Application, where the users can display their tasks and check the status for each one.

## Requirements:

1. **Set up your Github Repository:**
   - Continue working on the same `todo-project` repo.
   - Check out a new branch called `todo-js` for today's task.
   - Open it in VS code.


2. **Add functionality to your project:**:
    ***Phase 1 Requirements:***
   - Create a JavaScript file called `app.js` and link it with `index.html`.
   - When the home page is running you will do the following requirements in `app.js`:
      - Ask the user to enter his/her name as input.
      - Ask the user to enter his/her gender as input. The answer should be either (male or female).
      - Ask the user to enter his/her age as input and alert the user if the age is less than or equal to zero.
      - Ask the user to confirm if he/she wants to skip the welcoming message. 
      - Alert a welcoming message with the name of the user and the title Mr if the user is male and Ms if the user is female, and if the gender input is not correct alert the welcoming message without the title, according to the confirmation.
      - Continue working on the styling of the project.

    ***Phase 2 Requirements:***
   - As a user, I would like to answer more questions, so you should add new three (Yes/No) questions.
   - If the input was empty consider the answer as an "invalid" string.
   - Consider putting all the answers into an array.
   - Traverse the array and print the items on the console.
   - Confirm that your code is following the single responsibility rule. Each function should only do one thing.
   - All functions and variables should have a meaningful name (use camelCase).



## Submission Instructions:
- When your work is complete and ready for submission, push it to the `todo-js` branch.
- Create a pull request.
- Deploy to the Github pages.
- Submit the pull request and deployed version (Live URL) links.
- Merge `todo-js` with the main branch.
- What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
- How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?

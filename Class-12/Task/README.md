# Restaurant Project

## Task 12

### **Overview**

You will continue building on what you achieved in the last lab.

## **Requirements**

### **Set up your Github Repository***

- Today you will continue working on your `Restaurant` repo.
- Update your **README** file to add your changes for today.
- Check out a new branch called `localStorage` for today's lab.
- Open it in VS code.

You will create a new page for this lab `statistics.html`.

### **Home page**
- Save the data from the `form` into the `local storage` as JSON format when you click on the submit button.

### **Statistics page**
1. `Header` for navigating to any other pages(same as the home page).
2. Move the `table` from the home page to the statistics page.
3. `Footer` will have some social media links with copyright(same as the home page).
4. Create a new JS file called `statistics.js` and render the data from the `local storage` (that you build in the `app.js`) into the table so you can keep the data even when you refresh the page. 

### **Style**

1. Add some style for the header and the footer.
2. Add backgrounds, font colors, google fonts, and any additional style.
3. Use a suitable color palette for your website. You can use [ColorHunt](https://colorhunt.co).

**Note:**
Be creative and make your page professional.

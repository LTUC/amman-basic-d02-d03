# Task 06:

## Overview:
Today will be the beginning of a multi-Task project, where you will build a ToDo List website called **ToDo**.

## Problem Domain:

## Requirements:

1. **Set up your Github Repository:**
   - Create a new repository called `todo-project`
   - Add a **README.md** file.
   - Clone this repo to your local machine.
   - Check out a new branch called `todo-html` for today's task.
   - Open it in VS code.
  
2. **You will create two pages, `index.html` and `about.html`**:
   1. Home Page (index.html):
      - In `Header`, add navigating to any other pages. It should also contain the name of the website along with the logo.
      - In `Main`, render a **table** with two columns, one for the tasks and the second for the status. You should add at least 3 tasks.
      - In `Footer`, you should have copyright and anything you feel fits on your website.

   2. About Page:
      - In `Header`, add navigating to any other pages. It should also contain the name of the website along with the logo.
      - In `Main`, you should contain two sections:

          - Section for static **form** where the user has to provide his contact information (name, email, message) and submit button.
      - In `Footer`, you should have copyright and anything you feel fits on your website.

3. **Style your app:**
    - Now, it is your job to style the website to be attractive as much as you can.

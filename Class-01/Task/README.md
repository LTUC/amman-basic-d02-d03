# Confirm Slack, GitHub, D2L, and Discord  Setup
Welcome to prep course , let’s confirm your accounts are ready for success! Take a moment to create consistent profiles for a few of the key tools you will use: **D2L**, **GitHub**, **Discord**, and **Slack**. Then introduce yourself in your new class-specific Slack channel.

## Profile Picture
You will need a photograph of your lovely face. Not your cat, flowers. Not a cartoon or bitmoji. Add a nice headshot so that we can learn your name faster and give you better feedback on assignments. Your profile picture should be identical across D2L, GitHub, Discord, and Slack.

## Get Familiar with Your Online Tools
* D2l is an LMS which lets you submit and track all assignments.
* GitHub is the online place to store your code and collaborate with other developers using the Git version control system.
* Slack is a nice chat program that will let you communicate directly with classmates, instructors, and TAs.
* Discord is a nice ticket program that will let you raise tickets during lab time so TAs will reach out to you and help you directly.

## D2L Setup
Please make sure that you have a D2L account and you're enrolled in your course.

## Github Setup
- Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).
- Sign up for a free account (Choose a professional username).

If you already have a GitHub account, Great! Complete any remaining steps.

- In the Profile section fill the following sections: Bio(small intro), Profile picture(Please make it professional).
- Let us know a bit about yourself by setting up your profile section. Display your full name, as it will appear on your resume.
- Add your profile picture. Remember, use the same image as your LMS profile and Slack!
- Pro Tip: Keep GitHub Presentable
- Make sure you are following best practices with your GitHub account to impress any potential employers who view it.
- Share a link to your profile, and invite your classmates to “star” your best repos, or follow you if they’d like.

## Slack Setup
- Use the link in your welcome email (or potentially found below this frame) to go to the class Slack Workspace and configure your account.
- Use your same profile picture, if you haven’t already. Ensure your profile “Full name” field has your full name, as it will appear on your resume.
- Send a message in your class Slack channel with a brief introduction.
- You can find your class channel under “Channels” in the sidebar.
- Your class channel will have the same name as the course code for your class.
- In your intro message be sure to include:
   - Your name, pronouns, location (and timezone?)
   - Your background and previous experience
   - Your computer operating system and version number
   - Why you are excited about this class
- Explore the other available channels, and feel free to join and participate in any others that look interesting to you.
- Slack offers both desktop and mobile application versions. Once your account is configured, download and install both of those, too.

## Discord Setup
You just have to join our discord bot by using the link that has been sent in your class channel in Slack). Please note that you have to have an active email because Discord will ask you to use an email to sign up. 

## Requirement regarding installation

By the time you’ve completed the guide, you should be able to run the following commands in your terminal and have each report a version number of what’s installed.
```
code --version
```
```
git --version
```
```
node --version
```
```
npm --version
